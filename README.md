problem sets and studios from cs50x-STL

I am currently a student in cs50x who has completed all of the problem sets for C (including the server.c pset6) and absolutely enjoy coding in C. I would still classify myself as learning C, but have delved fairly deep and truly love the logic and problem solving inherent in coding. cs50x has also had us code in HTML/CSS, php, SQL, javaScript, jQuery and AJAX. I very much enjoyed combining php and SQL and have just skimmed the tip of the iceberg that is javaScript. I have chosen the skills-track of java and look forward to learning object-oriented programming. I have also dabbled in C++ via SoloLearn.
