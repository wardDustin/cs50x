0.  An english word that is a type of lung cancer called silicosis and is currently the longest english word in the dictionary
1.  Returns resource useage statistics for a calling process
2.  16, but only 9 are maintained
3.  Because we want to see the value at a certain point in the runtime, instead of just at the end
4.  The for loop runs while the fgetc function does not equal the end of the file. While it is running, fgetc grabs a char from the first line and iterates by grabbing one char at a time. It then
inserts that char into an array[index] and adds one to the variable index. The loop checks many things, such as: if index is bigger than 45 (if so it ignores it by going through the rest of the
word and then resetting index to zero), if the char is an alphabetical char, if the word has a digit in it (and promptly ignores that, too). When the loop comes to a "\n", the program knows it has
come to the end of a word, updates the word counter, checks for misspellings and then reports the time lapsed by all the processes
5.  Words longer than the defined LENGTH and words with digits could get passed using fscanf
6.  Because the dictionary and the word that is checked for spelling do not and should not change
